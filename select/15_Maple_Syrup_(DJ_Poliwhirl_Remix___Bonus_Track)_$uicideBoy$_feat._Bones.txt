This a $crim beat
Yung Christ
5-9
DJ $crim with that 808

Crack up in my swisher
Blowing bitches kisses
Syrup got me twisted
Now we G9 the misfits
Swerving and I'm fucked up
Serving time I'm locked up
Chopper spraying mac truck
You live a life of bad luck
All my hoes do drugs
All my homies thugs
Bitches fucking scrubs
Explorer on some dubs
This that flex on them with no mercy
That text I get at 1: 30
Yo bitch begging to get fucked
Leggings on but I rip them up
Just enough to slide up in
All about them Benjamin's
Dead presidents
I'm heaven sent
You just a fuck boy
That's irrelevant
Bow down to your sensei
Yung Mutt
You talking to a God boy
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Swerving passed the Church in all black clothing
Holding up a middle finger
Mac showing
Throwing cash hoes run and clash
Get their back broken
Gimme that fucking money
Pop the cap open
Throat soaking in some liquid potion
Ocean motion
Toasting to the stars
Got a great view from Mars
Spit a couple bars just to show it ain't hard
5-9 ain't far from the start
All brain and heart
Gotta play your part in the game
Make sure you aim the dart

Fresh fruit by the platter
Sipping water
Hear it splatter
Got ash on my shirt
But I'm me so it never matter
Fuck a job stay at home
Rolling bones until I'm gone
Hair ties on my wrist
This the doped up ghost
Laying in my bed feeling dead now
Money stashed in my pocket with the bands now
I don't like rap cause they do it wrong
I'm isolated cause I cannot take this shit no more
Laying in my bed now feeling kind of dead now
Money stashed up in my pocket with the bands now
I don't like rap cause they do it wrong
I'm isolated cause I cannot take this shit no more
What? what? I cannot take this shit no more
